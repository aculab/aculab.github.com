    - title : Molecular genetics of programmed cell death in plants
      description : |
        One of the long range scientific goals of our laboratory is to understand
        the process of developmentally regulated programed cell death (PCD) in
        plants by using a combination of genetics, reverse genetics, molecular
        and cell biological approaches.
