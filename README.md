hosted on [github pages](http://dcalderon.github.com/).

## TO DO

Build site/modify
Fix responsiveness
Get a custom bootstrap javascript thing for stuff I want...
Consider simply making one static page that displays all the information?
change colors
Add tools to make easy to maintain
Add basic content
Create full proof framework for github - possibly set up ultimate config so that you just have to update site variables and everything is set up from there...
Add too mojombo

## How to

Eventually I'll compile a list of important functions and guide users how to edit the site through the gitHub interface.
